2FSK600 refers to a signal that uses Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation technique with a frequency separation of 600 Hz between the two frequencies used for encoding data. Similar to 2FSK200, 2FSK600 is a digital modulation method commonly used in communication systems to transmit binary information. In this case, two different frequencies are used to represent the two binary states (0 and 1) of the transmitted data, and the frequency difference between these two tones is 600 Hz. The signal is often used in various applications, including wireless communication, digital data transmission, and remote control systems.
