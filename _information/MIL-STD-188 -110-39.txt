MIL-STD-188-110-39 is a military standard that pertains to the technical specifications for High-Frequency (HF) radio waveforms used in communication systems. This standard is specifically focused on the Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) protocols, which are used to establish reliable and secure communication links in HF radio networks.

HF radio communication is widely used by the military and other government agencies for long-range and beyond-line-of-sight communications. However, HF communication is often affected by changes in ionospheric conditions, atmospheric noise, and other factors that can cause signal variations and disruptions.

The purpose of MIL-STD-188-110-39 is to define the specific parameters and procedures for ALE, which allows HF radios to automatically and rapidly select appropriate frequencies and modes of operation based on current ionospheric conditions and link requirements. By doing so, ALE improves the efficiency and reliability of HF communication, ensuring that critical information can be transmitted even under challenging conditions.
