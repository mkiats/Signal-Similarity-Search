Tone burst refers to a short burst of a pure sinusoidal tone that is often used in various applications, including communications, radar, and acoustic testing. It is a type of signal characterized by its brief duration and narrow frequency bandwidth.

The tone burst signal is generated by abruptly turning on and off a continuous wave (CW) signal at a specific frequency. This creates a short burst of the pure tone at the desired frequency, followed by silence. The duration of the burst is typically very short, on the order of milliseconds or even microseconds.

In communications, tone bursts can be used for various purposes, such as synchronizing or calibrating receivers, testing the performance of audio equipment, or conveying specific signals in certain protocols.

In radar systems, tone bursts are employed for pulse compression techniques. By using a long time-bandwidth product, the radar system can achieve higher resolution and better target discrimination.

In acoustic testing, tone bursts can be used to excite or stimulate a system, such as measuring the frequency response of a loudspeaker or microphone.
