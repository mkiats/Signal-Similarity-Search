Morse code is a method of encoding text characters using sequences of dots and dashes to represent letters, numbers, and other symbols. It was developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for use in telegraphy systems. In Morse code, each letter of the alphabet and each number is represented by a unique combination of short signals (dots) and longer signals (dashes).

For example, the letter "S" is represented by three short signals (dot-dot-dot), and the letter "O" is represented by three longer signals (dash-dash-dash). Morse code is still used in some applications today, such as in amateur radio communication and emergency signaling.

Each character in Morse code can be represented as a sequence of dots and dashes, and the spaces between characters and words are also encoded with specific pauses. This encoding allows messages to be transmitted over long distances using simple telegraphy equipment. Morse code was widely used in telegraphy and radio communication before the advent of modern digital communication technologies.
