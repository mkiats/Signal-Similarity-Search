MLine is a type of signal that is characterized by multiple spectral lines in the frequency domain. In radio frequency (RF) and signal processing contexts, a spectral line refers to a distinct peak or spike in the spectrum that represents the presence of a particular frequency component in the signal.

The MLine signal may have multiple spectral lines at different frequencies, each corresponding to specific features or information in the signal. These lines can be a result of various phenomena, such as modulation, interference, or the presence of multiple signal sources.

In signal analysis, identifying and understanding the spectral lines in an MLine signal is crucial for various applications, including signal classification, demodulation, and decoding. The presence and characteristics of these spectral lines can provide valuable information about the underlying signal and its properties.

MLine signals are commonly encountered in telecommunications, radio broadcasting, and wireless communication systems. Analyzing and processing MLine signals require advanced signal processing techniques, such as Fourier analysis, which allows researchers and engineers to decompose the signal into its individual frequency components and study each spectral line separately.
