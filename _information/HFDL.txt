HFDL (High-Frequency Data Link) is a communication protocol extensively used in aviation for long-range data exchange between aircraft and ground stations. Operating within the high-frequency (HF) radio band, typically between 2 to 30 MHz, HFDL enables reliable transmission of messages, position reports, weather updates, and other critical data between aircraft and airline operations centers. Employing various modulation and error correction techniques, HFDL ensures secure and efficient flight tracking and monitoring, contributing to enhanced aviation safety and operational efficiency, particularly in remote regions or oceanic routes. Its robust data link layer protocol facilitates seamless communication, making it an indispensable tool in modern aviation systems.
