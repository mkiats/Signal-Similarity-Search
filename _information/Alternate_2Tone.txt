Alternate_2Tone refers to a type of dual-tone modulation used in communication systems. It involves the alternating transmission of two different audio tones, each representing a binary digit (0 or 1). These tones are usually sinusoidal waveforms with distinct frequencies.

In Alternate_2Tone, the two tones are transmitted in an alternating pattern, with each tone representing a specific digital bit. For example, one tone may represent a binary 0, while the other represents a binary 1. The receiver decodes the received signal by detecting the specific frequencies of the alternating tones and interprets them as the corresponding binary sequence.

This modulation scheme is commonly used in various applications, including radio communication systems and data transmission. It provides a simple and efficient way to transmit binary data over an analog channel, allowing for reliable communication and data transfer.
