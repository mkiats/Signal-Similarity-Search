8FSK stands for 8-Level Frequency Shift Keying. It is a digital modulation technique used in communication systems to transmit data over a radio frequency channel. In 8FSK, different digital symbols are represented by different frequencies, and the receiver decodes these frequencies to recover the transmitted data.

In 8FSK, there are eight different frequencies that can be used to represent eight different symbols or bits. Each symbol is usually transmitted during a specific time interval, and the receiver samples the received signal to identify the frequency corresponding to each symbol.

8FSK is commonly used in various communication standards, including some wireless communication protocols and data transmission systems. It offers a balance between data rate and spectral efficiency and can provide reliable data transmission in various environments.
