JSM is a type of signal used in radio communications and telecommunications. JSM signals are short bursts of radio frequency transmitted to mark specific points or events within a data transmission or communication sequence.

In the context of radio communications, JSM signals are used for various purposes, including synchronization, timing, and error correction. They serve as reference markers that help receivers identify specific portions of transmitted data, allowing for accurate data retrieval and decoding.

JSM signals are commonly used in digital communication systems, such as satellite communication, wireless communication, and data transmission over networks. They play a critical role in ensuring the integrity and reliability of the transmitted data, especially in environments with potential signal interference or noise.
