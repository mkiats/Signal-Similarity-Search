2Tone95 refers to a signal with a two-tone modulation and a frequency separation of 95 Hz between the two tones. Two-tone modulation is a type of amplitude modulation (AM) where two different frequencies are combined to create the signal. The signal consists of two sinusoidal waves of different frequencies, and the mixing of these tones produces variations in the amplitude, which can carry information.

In the case of 2Tone95, the signal has two sinusoidal tones with a frequency difference of 95 Hz. This type of modulation can be used in various applications, including telecommunications, audio transmission, and radio communication. The specific use and context of 2Tone95 may vary depending on the domain and application in which it is utilized.
