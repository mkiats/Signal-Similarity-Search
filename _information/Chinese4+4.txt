CODAR stands for "Coastal Ocean Dynamics Applications Radar." It is a type of coastal radar system used to measure ocean surface currents, wave direction, and wave height. CODAR uses high-frequency radio waves to track the motion of the sea surface scatterers, such as breaking waves, floating debris, and air-sea turbulence, to estimate the ocean currents and wave characteristics. This information is valuable for various oceanographic and coastal monitoring applications, including search and rescue operations, pollution tracking, and understanding coastal dynamics.
