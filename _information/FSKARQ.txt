"FSKARQ" refers to Frequency-Shift Keying with Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). FSKARQ is a type of digital modulation scheme used in telecommunications and data communication systems.

In FSKARQ, the data is modulated by shifting the carrier frequency between two or more discrete frequencies, each representing a different symbol. The receiver then demodulates the received signal to recover the transmitted data. The ARQ aspect of FSKARQ involves an error-control protocol, where the receiver requests the sender to retransmit any data that is received with errors or missing.

Overall, FSKARQ is a reliable and robust modulation scheme used in various communication systems to ensure accurate data transmission and reception, especially in noisy or error-prone environments.
