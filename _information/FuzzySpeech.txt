"FuzzySpeech" refers to a type of speech signal that exhibits a fuzzy or distorted quality due to various factors, such as noise, interference, or poor transmission conditions. Unlike clean and clear speech signals, which are easily understandable and intelligible, fuzzy speech signals may have reduced clarity, sharpness, and distinctiveness, making them more challenging to comprehend.
