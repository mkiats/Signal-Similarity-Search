2FSK200 refers to a signal that utilizes Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation technique with a frequency separation of 200 Hz between the two frequencies used for encoding data. FSK is a digital modulation method commonly used in communication systems to transmit binary information. In 2FSK, two different frequencies are used to represent the two binary states (0 and 1) of the transmitted data, and the frequency difference between these two tones is 200 Hz. The signal may be used in various applications, including wireless communication and digital data transmission.
